The report chooses “Measuring and Understanding Behavior, Welfare, and Poverty”, an academic literature on economics written by the Nobel laureate Deaton in 2015, as the source text to be translated into Chinese. “Measuring and Understanding Behavior, Welfare, and Poverty” stands as a prestigious passage as well as a revealing speech concerning the issues of international poverty alleviation, consumer behavior and social welfare; it mainly explores and illustrates the outcomes of home surveys worldwide, trying to make thought-provoking explanations about the economic disparities among different countries and regions. Featured with a battery of terminologies and professional expressions, this text is also deluged with long academic sentences, passive voice, personal and demonstrative pronouns and so forth, which poses major obstacles during the translation process for a nonprofessional in the field of economics.

Limitations, however, arise in the report. Firstly, this report is not a complete summary and discussion about the translation strategies which can be skillfully adopted in the rendering process of academic literature on economics; secondly, nine kinds of translation strategies mentioned above haven’t yet been proved whether they are universally applicable, equally effective in other kinds of relative texts including scientific articles and expository writings.

As a result, it is suggested that a more systematic and comprehensive study of translation strategies for academic literature on economics need to be made. Moreover, ...
